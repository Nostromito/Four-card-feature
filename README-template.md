## Overview

A recreation of a Front end mentor challenge that throws a couple of curve balls at you. It was a fun challenge that, while not hard, I needed some thought and outside help for. Very enjoyable.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [Solution](https://github.com/Nostromito/Four-card-feature)
- Live Site URL: [Live site](https://nostromito.github.io/Four-card-feature/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The thing I got to work on most this recreation was css grid. It was my first time actually using grid so it took some getting use to compared to flex but I see the usefulness of it now.

### Continued development

I would love to continue my development in grid. I still have much to learn.
